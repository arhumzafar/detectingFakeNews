# detectingFakeNews
#### Arhum Zafar


It's obvious that the internet has made accessing information easy to all around the world. Unfortunately, the internet has slowly turned into a hub of misinformation, or what many would call, "fake news". The problem arises when misinformation falls into the minds of wrong people, who are then convinced or persuaded to act out on the false narratives that they've heard; this can be proven by the fact of how many riots and killings have taken place in the past year.

Fake news can even sway people's opinions and affiliations - a fact that political parties have used (and still use) to make people vote in their favour. This enhances the need to find the ability to seperate what's real from what's not. For many, doing such a thing is a difficult task -- in this notebook, I use machine learning, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify what's fake apart from the real news.

The dataset I used can be found here:          [Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nxzl8Iw0rlpwcEvz4pVgFWX6qpgG4drx/view?usp=sharing) and [Train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ylkzJvO1gc2X9RB2BViQJYJSV4a1-msk/view?usp=sharing)
